# Guides Palette

Guides Palette is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/).

## Usage

Guides Palette can list all the *global* guides with names. Then you can assign them to certain glyphs independently. Guides will display or hide automatically. Helpful for complex design systems such as CJK characters.

QUICK NOTE: Guides with same names will make the plugin unhappy (the behavior will be unpredictable), so please keep the names unique.

### Custom parameters

Guides Palette uses the font custom parameter `Guides Palette Config` to control the appearance of the palette. It can be set with the following format:

    { sortBy = <s>; showAngle = <a>; showCoordinates = <c>; tagPrefix = <px>; }

where

- `<s>` can be
  - `""`: None, do not sort (default)
  - `"name"`: sort by name
  - `"x"`or `"y"`: sort by x or y coordinate
  - `"-x"` or `"-y"`: sort by x or y coordinate (inverse)
- `<a>` and `<c>` can be
  - `"1"`: show (default)
  - `"0"`: not show
- `<px>` can be
  - `"guide_"`: Default prefix, and `""` (None) will be treated as `"guide_"`
  - or Any other string, eg: `"G-"` or `"ÂèÇËÄÉÁ∫øÔºö"`
  - or Emoji, eg: `"üìê"` or `"üö∏"`
  - WARNING: Guides Palette will take over all tags with this prefix (auto rename and clean up). Keep your own prefixs away with this bad boy.

Note:

- Each entry can be omitted
- Each entry should end with a semicolon `;` (even for the last one)
- Glyphs will add quotation marks for the values (e.g. `"-x"`), but it's not mandatary

Example:

    { sortBy = -y; showAngle = 0; }

### Remarks

Internally, Guides Palette will add tags like `guide_NAME` for each glyph with guide `NAME`. It's not recommended to edit these tags manually or with plugins like [GutenTag](https://github.com/florianpircher/GutenTag).
